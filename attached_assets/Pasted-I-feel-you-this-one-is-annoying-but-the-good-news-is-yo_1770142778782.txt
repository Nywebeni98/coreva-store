I feel you 😤 — this one is annoying, but the good news is:
👉 your app is NOT broken
👉 Vercel is just stricter than Replit/Windows

Let’s fix it properly.

🚨 REAL ERROR (this is the blocker)
[vite]: Rollup failed to resolve import 
"@assets/COREVA-removebg-preview_(1)_1769981866385.png"
from "client/src/components/header.tsx"


This means Vercel cannot find that image file during build.

💥 WHY IT WORKS ON REPLIT BUT FAILS ON VERCEL
1️⃣ Case-sensitive file system

Windows / Replit → NOT strict

Vercel (Linux) → VERY strict

So this breaks deployment:

import logo from "@assets/COREVA-removebg-preview_(1)_1769981866385.png"


if the actual file is:

coreva-removebg-preview_(1)_1769981866385.png


or even:

COREVA-removebg-preview (1)_1769981866385.png


⚠️ ONE letter difference = build fails

2️⃣ File may NOT be committed to GitHub

If the image exists locally but was never pushed, Vercel will never see it.

✅ STEP-BY-STEP FIX (DO THIS EXACTLY)
✅ STEP 1: Check the real file name in GitHub

Open your repo:

client/src/assets/


✔️ Confirm:

Exact spelling

Exact CAPITAL letters

Exact symbols () _ -

✅ STEP 2: Rename the image (BEST PRACTICE)

Rename the file to something simple:

coreva-logo.png


(no spaces, no brackets, no timestamps)

✅ STEP 3: Update the import

In header.tsx:

import logo from "@/assets/coreva-logo.png";


⚠️ Make sure:

@ alias exists in vite.config.ts

OR use relative path:

import logo from "../assets/coreva-logo.png";

✅ STEP 4: Commit & push again

Run locally or in Replit:

git status
git add .
git commit -m "Fix asset import for Vercel build"
git push origin main

🧠 EXTRA IMPORTANT CHECK (ALIAS ISSUE)

If you use @assets, confirm this exists in vite config:

resolve: {
  alias: {
    "@": "/client/src",
    "@assets": "/client/src/assets"
  }
}


⚠️ If @assets is NOT defined → Vercel WILL FAIL

Safer option:

import logo from "@/assets/coreva-logo.png";

🚫 DO NOT DO THIS

❌ Don’t add it to rollupOptions.external
❌ Don’t ignore the error
❌ Don’t keep complex file names from Figma/Canva exports

✅ WHY THIS FIX WORKS

✔ Linux-safe paths
✔ GitHub-safe assets
✔ Vercel-compatible build
✔ Future-proof
